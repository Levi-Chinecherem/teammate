Below is an architectural visualization of the "Teammate" system using a directed graph (digraph) in the DOT language, similar to your example. This graph represents the full system, including the central intelligence (Teammate) and all sub-agents, along with their interactions and data flow. It’s designed to reflect the multi-agent architecture, Microsoft Teams integration, and the flow of commands and responses. I'll adapt the structure to fit Teammate’s functionality, ensuring a clear top-to-bottom (TB) flow with subgraphs where appropriate.

### Explanation of the Graph
1. **TeamsInterface (Top Level)**:
   - Represents the Microsoft Teams bot interface where users interact with Teammate via text or voice commands.
   - Entry point for all interactions.

2. **Teammate (Central Intelligence)**:
   - Acts as the orchestrator, built with LangGraph, receiving commands from Teams and routing them to the appropriate sub-agent.
   - Highlighted in green to signify its central role.

3. **Sub-Agents (Cluster)**:
   - Six sub-agents (Scheduler, Note-Taker, Presenter, Communicator, Document-Reader, Suggestor) are grouped in a dashed cluster to show they operate as modular nodes under Teammate’s control.
   - Each sub-agent has specific responsibilities and interactions with external systems.

4. **External Systems (Cluster)**:
   - Includes PostgreSQL (Database), Azure Speech Service, Microsoft Graph API, and the GPT-like LLM.
   - Grouped to indicate dependencies shared across sub-agents.

5. **Data Flow**:
   - **Command Flow**: TeamsInterface → Teammate → Sub-Agents.
   - **Processing Flow**: Sub-Agents interact with external systems (e.g., GraphAPI for scheduling, SpeechService for voice).
   - **Output Flow**: Sub-Agents → Output → TeamsInterface, delivering results back to users.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Presenter checks visibility with TeamsInterface and adjusts sharing accordingly.

6. **Output Node**:
   - Represents the final delivery mechanism (text messages, voice responses, slide displays), highlighted in pink for visibility.

### Visualization Notes
- **Rank Direction (TB)**: Top-to-bottom flow reflects the natural progression from user input to system output.
- **Colors**: Used to differentiate layers (blue for Teams, green for Teammate, yellow for external systems, pink for output).
- **Subgraphs**: Cluster sub-agents and external systems for clarity and to emphasize modularity.
- **Labels**: Edges are labeled with specific actions (e.g., "Send message/call") to show the purpose of each connection.

### How to Visualize
To see this graph visually:
1. **Online Tool**: Copy the DOT code into a tool like [GraphvizOnline](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) or [Edotor](https://edotor.net/).
2. **Local Tool**: Install Graphviz (`pip install graphviz` or via system package manager) and render it with:
   ```bash
   dot -Tpng teammate_system.dot -o teammate_system.png
   ```
   (Save the DOT code in a file named `teammate_system.dot`.)

### Alignment with Teammate’s README
This graph mirrors the README’s architecture:
- **Teams Integration**: Handled by TeamsInterface and GraphAPI.
- **Sub-Agents**: All six are represented with their specific roles.
- **Document Reading**: DocumentReader connects to various processing tools via Database and SpeechService.
- **Suggestions**: Suggestor uses LLM for reasoning.
- **Presentation**: Presenter includes the screen-sharing verification loop.
- **Reminders**: Scheduler triggers Communicator for calls/texts.
